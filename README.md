# Project: Predicting Boston Housing Prices
## My 3rd Project in the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree at [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)

### Link to the Udacity project repository

https://github.com/udacity/machine-learning/tree/master/projects/customer_segments

### Project Overview
In this project I applied unsupervised learning techniques on product spending data collected for customers of a wholesale distributor in Lisbon, Portugal to identify customer segments hidden in the data.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)

### Run

In order to run the code in the jupyter notebook you also need the files **housing.csv** and **visuals.py**. You can find these files in the Udacity project repository linked in the beginning of this readme.

Load the file with jupyter notebook using the following command:

```jupyter notebook customer_segments.ipynb```
